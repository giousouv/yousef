## Technologies
HTML5: The structure of the webpage is written in HTML5, as indicated by the "<!DOCTYPE html>" declaration at the beginning of the document and the use of HTML5 semantic elements such as "<html>", "<head>", "<title>", "<body>", "<form>", "<input>", "<button>", and "<div>".

CSS3: Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are used to style the HTML elements. Various CSS properties like background-color, font-family, padding, margin, box-sizing, box-shadow, border-radius, color, width, cursor, etc., are utilized for styling.

JavaScript (ECMAScript): JavaScript is used for client-side scripting to add interactivity to the webpage. The <script> tag contains JavaScript code that validates the login form and displays error messages accordingly. Event handling is done using inline event attributes (onclick) to trigger the validateLogin() function when the login button is clicked.
